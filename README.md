This project consists in optimizing the C code "body.c".

At each optimization, we provide the final result in order to know if it is effective or not.

A report (in French) "rapport_slim_khiari" has been written to summarize my work done in this project.

Optimizations are cumulative: if a good optimization is obtained with a technique "i", we continue to search for another optimization "i+1" to add it to the optimization "i".
